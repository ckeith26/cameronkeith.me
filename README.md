# SA0 [Cameronkeith.me](http://cameronkeith.me) Setup
[deployed url](http://cameronkeith.me)

*description*
I adhered to all SA0 guidelines, and I connected my gh-pages website repository to my personal domain, [cameronkeith.me](http://cameronkeith.me).

## What Worked Well
- 1: created basic website structure with [index.html](./cameronkeith.me/index.html) and set `main` branch to `gh-pages`
- 2: reserved student domain name on namecheap
- 3: added [CNAME file](./cameronkeith.me/CNAME)

## What Didn't
- 1: Nothing according to SA0 specs

## Extra Credit
- 1: added cool gif
