# My ROI on College [Cameronkeith.me](http://cameronkeith.me)
*description*
I met all Lab 1, Part 2 guidelines, and have created the basic structure for a startup idea, `My ROI on College`.

`My ROI on College` is a platform designed to help students make informed decisions about their educational journey and career prospects. Leveraging artificial intelligence, our platform provides personalized insights to quantify the value of attending college versus exploring alternative paths. Whether you're assessing rankings, exploring career opportunities, or evaluating pricing options, `My ROI on College` equips you with the tools to unlock your full potential.

I drew web dev inspiration from [stripe.com](http://stripe.com) and [strangeworks.com](http://strangeworks.com)

I also use an AI to search through the docs in order to familiarize myself with the languages faster.

## What Worked Well

- I based my structure on Stripe's general layout, and have designed the higher level modules for each section of `My ROI on College`. 

## What Didn't

- scroll effects, because I could not find a way to detect scrolling in the docs.
- I had to reduce the scope of this project in terms of getting real ROI data and just use placeholder visuals for CSS.

## Extra Credit
- call to action text appears and disappears. button arrow moves when you hover over "Discover your ROI on College today ->"
